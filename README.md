# Doubly-Linked-List-In-Python

Doubly linked list is a complex type of linked list where a node contains a pointer to the previous as well as the next node in the sequence. Therefore, in a doubly-linked list, a node consists of three components: node data, pointer to the next node in node(next pointer), pointer to the former node (previous pointer).
